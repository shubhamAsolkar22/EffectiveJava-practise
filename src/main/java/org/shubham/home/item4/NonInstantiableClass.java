	 * include a comment, as shown above. 
	 * 
	 * As a side effect, this idiom also prevents

	 * constructor, explicitly or implicitly, and a subclass would have no
	 * accessible superclass constructor to invoke.

	 * Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does
	 * not work. The class can be subclassed and the subclass instantiated. Furthermore,
	 * it misleads the user into thinking the class was designed for inheritance (Item 19).
	 * There is, however, a simple idiom to ensure noninstantiability. A default constructor
	 * is generated only if a class contains no explicit constructors, so a class can be
	 * made noninstantiable by including a private constructor:
	
	// Noninstantiable utility class

	// Suppress default constructor for noninstantiability
	private UtilityClass() {
	throw new AssertionError();
